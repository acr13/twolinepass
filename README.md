My NHL Advanced Statistics Playground

I originally wrote this web app in in the Fall / Winter of 2013, going live just before the new year. It was more of a test to see if I can actually parse the NHL HTML game logs, and create some sort of meaningful data with it. Whether that meant looking at a phpmyadmin page, a formatted table, or if I was lucky enough - making an informed decision in one of my fantasy hockey leagues.

The entire back end is written in php, using phpQuery for all of the DOM manipulation to actually scrape the data. Behind that is a simple MySQL database to round off the LAMP stack nicely.

My next goal will be to convert this all to rails for the Fall / Winter of 2014.
